    "## Conclusion et recommandations\n",
    "\n",
    "Ce projet de modélisation prédictive du churn client dans le secteur des télécommunications a permis :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **De construire et comparer plusieurs modèles** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)\n",
    "- **D’identifier le modèle LightGBM optimisé comme le plus performant**, avec une accuracy de 79.96 % et un bon compromis entre précision (66 %) et rappel (50 %) sur la classe \"churn\".\n",
    "- **De fournir des outils métier** concrets comme la prédiction automatique sur de nouveaux clients via un fichier Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommandations métier\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prioriser les clients avec une probabilité de churn > 70 %** pour les campagnes de rétention.\n",
    "- **Analyser les profils les plus à risque** (clients avec contrat mensuel, fibre optique, pas de service de sécurité ou support technique).\n",
    "- **Automatiser le modèle dans un outil no-code ou un dashboard Power BI** pour faciliter l’usage par les équipes marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limites et pistes d’amélioration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prendre en compte d'autres variables externes (satisfaction, retours SAV, interactions récentes).\n",
    "- Tester des modèles de deep learning ou hybrides.\n",
    "- Envisager un suivi mensuel du churn avec un système de monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Ce modèle est prêt à être **déployé en environnement réel** pour améliorer la rétention client et guider les décisions stratégiques.\n"
